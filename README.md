# Aura Glow Supply Chain & Inventory Optimization
## Project Summary
This project demonstrates an end-to-end supply chain analysis and inventory management solution. Using Python for advanced sales forecasting and Tableau for interactive visualization, I developed a data-driven system to predict demand, proactively manage inventory, and create a strategic purchase order plan.

## Visual Walkthrough of the Project
1. The Live Inventory Dashboard (Google Sheets)
A dynamic dashboard built in Google Sheets to monitor key metrics like Days of Supply and automatically flag inventory risks.



3. Advanced Sales Forecasting (Tableau)
An interactive line chart visualizing historical sales (Y) and a 6-month sales forecast (Yhat) generated using the Prophet library in Python.

4. Inventory Status Visualization (Tableau)
A color-coded chart that uses visual alerting (Green for "Healthy," Red for "Risk") to provide an at-a-glance view of inventory health across all SKUs.

5. The Final Dashboard (Tableau)
The complete, end-to-end dashboard combining all key insights, published and ready for sharing.



## Key Findings & Recommendations
**Data-Driven Purchase Plan (Q3 & Q4 2025)**: Based on the analysis, a purchase order of $1,665,600.00 was recommended to meet forecasted demand and prevent stockouts.

**Proactive Risk Management**: The dashboard provides a system to flag inventory risks early, allowing for timely decision-making.

## Technologies Used
